## Original skills

Written by the repository author; no third-party skill content:
`repo-map`, `proposal-review`, `maintainer-review`, `product-spec`, `system-blueprint`,
`codex-delegation`, `claude-delegation`, `agy-assist`, `agy-execution`,
`test-verification`, `local-ci`, `bounded-filesystem-cleanup-safety`,
`github-release-recovery`, `clean-action`.

## Contributed skills

`route-work` was written by a contributor for this repository. Its idea of an
explicit-only router that names the next skill and stops is inspired by Matt Pocock's
[ask-matt](https://www.aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt); no text from that skill is copied.

## Adapted skills

The following skills are personally adapted from the MIT-licensed
[mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) repository:

| Skills | Upstream revision | Adaptation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `grilling`, `run-pilot`, `plan-work` | `9603c1cc8118d08bc1b3bf34cf714f62178dea3b` | Personal workflow adaptation; bounded experiments and proportional planning. Synchronized from MyAgents `0d290ba`; `grilling` also adopts prerequisite handling from upstream `49dd158d1076134a641b33efb035946536778336`. |
| `wayfinder` | `9603c1cc8118d08bc1b3bf34cf714f62178dea3b` | Simplified to a local project map; adds outcome, current answer, focus and optional milestones, reader-first reports with dated evidence, route reassessment without granting execution authority, and a reading-budget checker. Sharing copy synchronized from MyAgents `0d290ba`. |
| `code-review`, `codebase-design` | `6654f6b60cd9d5be8b54c6fafe44346dabeb3b76` | Retained standards/spec review and module design guidance; removed mandatory delegation and assumed project tools. |
| `handoff` | `2ab958093e83e0ec752e6c1c5932da465bf23e0c` | Removed upstream `argument-hint` and implicit-invocation metadata, added Claude compatibility in MyAgents, and otherwise kept the upstream handoff body. The public copy also omits deployment metadata. |
| `improve-codebase-architecture` | `6654f6b60cd9d5be8b54c6fafe44346dabeb3b76` | Kept evidence-based architectural analysis while making delegation and visuals optional and removing assumed project-specific companion skills and workflows. |

`plan-work` also draws on
[`writing-plans`](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/blob/8ca22dba9a94f28898bbce59f2537ff4d87c747d/skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md)
from `obra/superpowers` at revision `8ca22dba9a94f28898bbce59f2537ff4d87c747d`.
The adaptation adds concrete interfaces, acceptance evidence, explicit execution
dependencies, and separate authorization for human communication and financial actions.
Its MIT license is retained in [LICENSE.superpowers](skills/plan-work/LICENSE.superpowers).

These are adapted skills, not unmodified upstream snapshots. Sharing adaptations also
omit personal deployment metadata. Upstream changes are reviewed and merged selectively;
when an adapted skill adopts newer upstream content, update its revision row above.
Ponytail and Stop That Shit are linked for separate installation; their plugin code is
not bundled here.
